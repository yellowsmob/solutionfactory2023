The Solution Factory, created by Jiwoo CHOI, Marie-Ange ACCROMBESSY, Nathan DUHAMEL, Zayed SALIM, Yann Caill√© ZEUTSOP TANKOUA, and Rihab ZOUITINA, aims to address the limitations of user ratings on the internet when it comes to providing meaningful information about the user experience. Our team is working on a system that can analyze user comments on products and extract the sentiments expressed. This application is designed to help companies gain a deeper understanding of consumer reactions and enhance their products or services based on these insights.
